# Keybox checker on python!
This code is purely made for education and research purposes. (And also because I have too much free time.)
# First time setup
First step is to have python already installed in your computer.\
Second step is to install all required dependencies :-

> [!TIP]
> Python virtual enviroment is highly recommended!
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
That's it! I mean its a python file.

# Usage
*Checking a single keybox*
```bash
python main.py path/to/keybox.xml
```
*Bulk checking a folder full of keybox*
```bash
python main.py path/to/keyboxs
```
